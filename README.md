# Productivity Project

## Productivity Tacker

This project if for developing a productivity tracker. The tracker is meant to
be a minimal tracker that can record time spent on specific projects.

>  This is meant to be as minimal as possible. The goal is to be able to easily
>  switch between different workflows while maintaining a full record of the
>  time spend on each.

## How to use

You will need `python 3.XX` in order to run this program. See the
[python documentation](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for download
instructions if needed. 

To download this project, run the following command.

```
git clone https://github.com/mark-ashmore/productivity.git
python3 productivity/productivity_tracker.py
```

TODO(mark-ashmore): Need to add the ability to quickly reduce the size of the
tracker and I need to add in the ability to save workflows and tracking
between sessions.
